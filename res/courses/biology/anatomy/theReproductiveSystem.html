<h2>Excretion In Humans</h2>

<h3>Excretion</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Excretion - removal of waste products of the metabolism from the body</li>
    <li>Metabolism - sum of the chemical reactions of a cell</li>
</ul>

<ul>

    <h4>1. How is Excretion different from egestion</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Egestion - removal of undigested food from alimentary canal through the anus. Does not come from the cells </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Main Excretory Substances</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Carbon Dioxide - waste product of cellular respiration. Excreted in the air that is exhaled</li>
        <li>Water - waste product of cellular respiration in all cells and consumed through food. Excess water is excreted in urine and sweat</li>
        <li>Bile Pigments - produced by the breakdown of haemoglobin. Takes place in the liver and excreted in faeces</li>
        <li>Urea - produced in the liver from excess proteins that are consumed. It is transported in the blood to the kidneys and excreted in urine </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Deamination</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In the liver the amino group (NH<sub>2</sub>) and another Hydrogen are removed from the excess amino acid molecules to form ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>).
            The ammonia is then combined with carbon dioxide to form urea</li>
    </ul>


</ul>
