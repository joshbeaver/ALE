<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_digestive_system">The Human Digestive System</a></h2>

<h3>Structure and Function</h3>

<p>Humans have a two-ended digestive tract (also called the alimentary canal or
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract">gastrointestinal tract</a>). The digestive
    system can be divided into tubular alimentary canal and accessory organs. <br>The overall function of the all the parts
    of the digestive system is to convert food into energy and basic nutrients to feed the entire body.
    <br>The following processes occur withing the digestive tract of humans:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ingestion- the intake of food from the mouth</li>
    <li>Digestion - the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food</li>
    <li>Absorption - the diffusion of simple food molecules through the intestinal wall into the blood</li>
    <li>Assimilation - incorporation of nutrients such as amino acids and glucose into the cell</li>
    <li>Egestion - the removal of undigested and unabsorbed waste from the body through the anus in the form of faeces</li>
</ul>

    <h4>Summarised Structure and Function of Parts of The Digestive System</h4>
    <ul>
        <h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mouth">The Mouth</a></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Teeth - prepare food for digestion by cutting and grinding (Mechanical Break Down)</li>
            <li>Tongue - forms floor of the mouth</li>
            <li>Hard and Soft Palate - forms roof of the mouth</li>
            <li>Stratified Epithelium - cells that line the mouth</li>
            <li>3 Pairs of Salivary Glands - produce saliva which assists the chemical breakdown of food</li>
            <li>The Uvula - flap of tissue hanging from the soft palate which closes the internal nasal passage during swallowing</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharynx">The Pharynx</a></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The pharynx is the area where the nasal passages and alimentary canal cross each other</li>
            <li>The pharynx leads to the oesophagus and trachea</li>
            <li>During swallowing the glottis is closed by the epiglottis</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus">The Oesophagus</a></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The oesophagus is a tube that lies behind the trachea</li>
            <li>It has thick muscular walls and is line with stratified epithelium cells</li>
            <li>It conducts food to the stomach</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach">The Stomach</a></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The stomach is a muscular bag-like organ</li>
            <li>The stomach walls are very thick</li>
            <li>At each opening the stomach has a valve like sphincter. The cardiac sphincter between the oesophagus and stomach
            <br> and the pyloric sphincter between the stomach and the duodenum. The sphincters ensure one way movement of food
            <br> and prevent reflux</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
